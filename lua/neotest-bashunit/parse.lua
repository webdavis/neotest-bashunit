-- Everything neotest-bashunit knows about bashunit's shapes, as pure functions
-- over strings and tables. No file system, no jobs, no neotest: the adapter in
-- init.lua owns those, so every rule below is testable by `tests/run.lua` under
-- a bare `nvim --headless --clean -l`, with no plugin installed.
--
-- Every rule and fixture here was measured against ONE bashunit release, named
-- by `M.verified_version` below and checked by this project's own gate. See
-- that field for why the check exists rather than a version pin.

---
---A release that changes an output shape would leave this adapter's frozen
---fixtures green while it silently misreported real runs, so the gate refuses
---to certify fixtures captured from a different release and names both
---versions. CI downloads this exact release asset and checks it against a
---pinned sha256, because a runner's cached Homebrew index poured 0.43.0 into a
---job measured on this version; that version, that checksum and this field
---must all move together by hand. The Homebrew declarations (Brewfile.dev, the
---machine package set) stay unpinned, since Homebrew has no declarative
---version pin, so on a local machine this gate is the only pin there is. That
---is the same trade the repository takes on stylua and for the same reason: a
---visible failure on an untouched file beats a silent behavior change.
---
---Moving this means re-measuring, not just editing: every fixture in
---tests/parse_spec.lua is transcribed from a run of this exact version.

-- by bash, enumerated by compgen and run (measured), so the parentheses may
